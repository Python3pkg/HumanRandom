Human Random
============

This Python module aims to provide a way to allow programmers to "randomize" lists and generate "random" integers that feel random to humans. It is not statistically random. Many people express discontent with random lists because they get distracted with the patterns they find in repeating or sequential values. For example, if a die rolls a certain number a few times in a row the user will feel like it is rigged or unfairly balanced. Another example is in shuffling playlists; many times the same artist will play twice in a row, and many people dislike that.
